Machine Learning Project: Predicting Salary vs. Working Hours

Project Overview:

Conducted a machine learning project to predict salary based on working hours using Polynomial Regression.
Collected and preprocessed a dataset comprising 1000 records of salary and corresponding working hours.
Key Achievements:

Developed and implemented a Polynomial Regression model using Python and popular libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn.
Performed exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset, identifying trends and outliers.
Conducted feature engineering to enhance the model's predictive accuracy, including polynomial feature expansion to capture non-linear relationships.
Employed cross-validation techniques to evaluate and fine-tune the model's hyperparameters, ensuring robust performance.
Achieved an impressive R-squared (RÂ²) value of [insert your actual R-squared value], indicating the model's ability to explain salary variations based on working hours.
Visualized the regression results using Matplotlib and Seaborn to provide intuitive and informative data representations.
Technical Skills Applied:
